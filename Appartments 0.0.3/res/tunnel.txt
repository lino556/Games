You see a hidden button at the far end of the cupboard.
It's so far back that you have submerge your entire upper body into the
dark opening. 
As you push the button you hear a click and feel the wood beneath you give way as the floor opens
and drops you several meters down...
A hard thud echoes through the darkness as you hit the cold damp floor.
